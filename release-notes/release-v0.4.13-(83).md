### Release v0.4.13 (83)

**Features**

- The number of credentials requested per PID batch is now 5 by default (previously 10).

- The presentation request is now fetched only once.
- The eID card PIN retry after a wrong PIN is fixed.
- Keyboard navigation on iOS 27 is fixed.
- Accessibility focus on the "no internet" popup is fixed.
